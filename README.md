## Introduction 
(you can skip this section if you just care about the project üëç)
My name is Isaac; I'm an undergraduate computer science student Kansas State University and a part-time software engineer at a company that makes Irrigation systems equipt with digital control systems. I'm into low-level programming, embedded sytems, and alternative agriculture. 


 
# Initial Writeup : mushroom farm automation
I will design an embedded system that manages fresh air exchange and humidity to optimize mycelium colinization rates without increasing risk of contamination compared with current techneques. 

## Problem
This system aims to solve a very niche problem that view people are likly aware of, so I will explain it here. Of the 

Mantain optimal growing conditions on a variatey of parameters:
* O2 Levels
	High levels of CO2 are not harmful to fungi, but lower oxygen concentrations slow growth significantly since O2 is needed for digestion. 
** 
 
* Humidity
	When sealed container technques are used, it is not possable to add more water to the substrate; careful calculations are required to determin the proper ratio of water to substrate. This ratio will differ significantly depending on the type of substrate used as well as the specice being produced. Because of the number of factors at play, guesswork is often involved, dispite how  important it is to get humidity correct : 
	* Insuffeciant moisture slows mycelial growth - wasting time.
	* Insuffeciant moisture bottlenecks the digestion of avalable nutrients, which will in turn reduce fruit output - wasting money.
	* Too much moisture makes the substrate more hospitable for a wider variaty of microrganisms, incresing risk (and therefore frequency) of contamination - wasting time and money.
Real time humidity control will elemenate the need for such calculations. Maintain an ideal humidity, and the mycelium should have access to as much water as it needs, even if the food source is compleatly dry at inoculation time. 




 Each cell in the Hyphae can secrete enzynms that digest whatever the colony is eating, but more imporantly, Hypha can act as nutrient transportation machines. 



Mushrooms are are the fruit produced by underground mycelial networks.

## Solution

## Objectives

* Use no GUI tools
	* Improve efficiency 
	* All work (including documentation) will be completed on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). I am typing this in nano RN.
